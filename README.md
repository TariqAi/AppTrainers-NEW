# Projects

## Tweets Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Built an NLP pipeline to classify tweets as positive or negative using
- machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Preprocessed text and applied TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Achieved strong performance metrics and visualized key insights
with WordClouds.

## CIFAR-10 (Image Classification)
- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify
- images into 10 object categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implemented the model using Keras with TensorFlow backend ,
- including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- I am building a system that segments customers into different groups based on their behavior and characteristics. For this use case
- I applied unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering.
- The process involved feature engineering, handling outliers, and using a heatmap to understand relationships between features.
- After scaling the data, I applied PCA for dimensionality reduction before performing clustering. 
- Finally, customer profiles were analyzed for each cluster to better understand distinct customer segments.

## Telco Customer Chrurn Prediction
- I am building a system that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay with the telecom company. 
- I am using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for our prediction.
- The data is preprocessed using Label Encoding and Standard Scaling, and to handle the class imbalance.
- I applied the SMOTE technique.
- The models are trained and evaluated using various metrics.

## Breast Cancer Classification (Neural-Network)
- In this dataset, I am building a system that can classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using breast cancer diagnostic data.
- I am using a Neural Network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is designed using a Sequential architecture with Dense layers, and the data is preprocessed using Standard Scaling to improve model performance. 
- The system is trained and tested using a standard train-test split to evaluate its accuracy and classification capability.
