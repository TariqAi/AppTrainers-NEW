🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
## Sentiment Analysis
- Built an NLP pipeline to classify tweets as positive or negative using
- machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Preprocessed text and applied TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Achieved strong performance metrics and visualized key insights
with WordClouds.

## CIFAR-10 (Image Classification)
Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify
images into 10 object categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Implemented the model using Keras with TensorFlow backend ,
including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Traffic Analysis & Prediction
Analyzed historical traffic data to identify patterns and predict
congestion trends.

Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and time series
modeling to forecast traffic volume.

Utilized regression models to achieve accurate short-term traffic
predictions.

## Heart Disease Prediction
User-friendly interface for inputting patient health data.

Predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes.

Utilizes a pre-trained Logistic Regression model.

Provides real-time predictions through Streamlit.
