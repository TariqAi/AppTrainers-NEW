# Projects

## Tweets Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Built an NLP pipeline to classify tweets as positive or negative using
- machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Preprocessed text and applied TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Achieved strong performance metrics and visualized key insights
with WordClouds.

## CIFAR-10 (Image Classification)
- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify
- images into 10 object categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implemented the model using Keras with TensorFlow backend ,
- including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- I am building a system that can segment customers into different groups based on their behavior and characteristics.
- I am using an Unsupervised Learning techniques to identify patterns and group similar customers together.
