# Projects

## Tweets Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Built an NLP pipeline to classify tweets as positive or negative using
- machine learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Preprocessed text and applied TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- Achieved strong performance metrics and visualized key insights
with WordClouds.

## CIFAR-10 (Image Classification)
- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify
- images into 10 object categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implemented the model using Keras with TensorFlow backend ,
- including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

## Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- I am building a system that can segment customers into different groups based on their behavior and characteristics.
- I am using an Unsupervised Learning techniques to identify patterns and group similar customers together.

## Telco Customer Chrurn Prediction
- I am building a system that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay with the telecom company. 
- I am using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for our prediction.
- The data is preprocessed using Label Encoding and Standard Scaling, and to handle the class imbalance.
- I applied the SMOTE technique.
- The models are trained and evaluated using various metrics.

## Breast Cancer Classification (Neural-Network)
- In this dataset, I am building a system that can classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using breast cancer diagnostic data.
- I am using a Neural Network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is designed using a Sequential architecture with Dense layers, and the data is preprocessed using Standard Scaling to improve model performance. 
- The system is trained and tested using a standard train-test split to evaluate its accuracy and classification capability.
